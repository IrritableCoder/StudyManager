# Study Manager
This is a Python script for working with a locally hosted SQL table.
It is primarily for seeing how much time you spend studying. 

# Functionality:
Using this script you will be able to add the date, your name, the title of the lesson you worked on, and the duration of the lesson.
You will then be able to sum up the duration of the lessons that you worked on for a given day.

You can also create a table, delete a table, and delete an rows of a table (1 row at a time, I'm working on improving ths) 

# Some Notes:
1. You will need to set up a MySQL database and connect to it to use this script's functions
2. This little program does not flow very well (I'm working on improving it)
